Calculate the probability that $X$ is less than or equal to 1.

The length of the field is twice its width. The school committee has allocated an area of 1800 square meters for the field. Additionally, they want to fence the entire field. Calculate the total length of the fencing required. To determine the total length of the fencing required for the rectangular sports field, we need to follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Define the variables:**\\n   Let the width of the field be \\\\( w \\\\) meters.\\n   Since the length of the field is twice its width, the length will be \\\\( 2w \\\\) meters.\\n\\n2. **Set up the equation for the area:**\\n   The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\text{Area} = \\\\text{length} \\\\times \\\\text{width}\\n   \\\\]\\n   Substituting the given values, we get:\\n   \\\\[\\n   1800 = 2w \\\\times w\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying this, we have:\\n   \\\\[\\n   1800 = 2w^2\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. **Solve for \\\\( w \\\\):**\\n   Divide both sides of the equation by 2:\\n   \\\\[\\n   w^2 = 900\\n   \\\\]\\n   Take the square root of both sides:\\n   \\\\[\\n   w = \\\\sqrt{900} = 30\\n   \\\\]\\n   So, the width of the field is 30 meters. Since the length is twice the width, the length is:\\n   \\\\[\\n   2w = 2 \\\\times 30 = 60 \\\\text{ meters}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. **Calculate the perimeter of the field:**\\n   The perimeter \\\\( P \\\\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\\n   \\\\[\\n   P = 2 \\\\times (\\\\text{length} + \\\\text{width})\\n   \\\\]\\n   Substituting the values of the length and width, we get:\\n   \\\\[\\n   P = 2 \\\\times (60 + 30) = 2 \\\\times 90 = 180 \\\\text{ meters}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nTherefore, the total length of the fencing required is \\\\(\\\\boxed{180}\\\\) meters.',\n",

A line through $P$ intersects $C$ at two points $A$ and $B$. If the length of the chord $AB$ is $2\\\\sqrt{r^2 - k^2}$, where $k$ is a constant, find the value of $k$ in terms of $r$ and $d$.\\nTo find the value of \\\\( k \\\\) in terms of \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\), we start by using the power of a point theorem. The power of point \\\\( P \\\\) with respect to the circle \\\\( C \\\\) is given by the product of the lengths of the segments of the chord through \\\\( P \\\\). If the chord \\\\( AB \\\\) intersects the circle at points \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), then the power of point \\\\( P \\\\) is \\\\( PA \\\\cdot PB \\\\).\\n\\nThe power of point \\\\( P \\\\) can also be expressed as the difference between the square of the distance from \\\\( P \\\\) to the center of the circle and the square of the radius of the circle. Therefore, we have:\\n\\\\[\\nPA \\\\cdot PB = d^2 - r^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\nNext, we use the fact that the length of the chord \\\\( AB \\\\) is given as \\\\( 2\\\\sqrt{r^2 - k^2} \\\\). Let the perpendicular from the center of the circle to the chord \\\\( AB \\\\) meet \\\\( AB \\\\) at point \\\\( M \\\\). Since \\\\( M \\\\) is the midpoint of \\\\( AB \\\\), we have \\\\( AM = MB = \\\\sqrt{r^2 - k^2} \\\\). The distance from the center of the circle to the chord \\\\( AB \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\sqrt{r^2 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{AB}{2}\\\\right)^2} = \\\\sqrt{r^2 - \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{r^2 - k^2}\\\\right)^2} = \\\\sqrt{r^2 - (r^2 - k^2)} = \\\\sqrt{k^2} = k \\\\).\\n\\nNow, consider the right triangle formed by the radius of the circle, the distance from the center to the chord, and the segment from the center to point \\\\( P \\\\). The length of the segment from the center to \\\\( P \\\\) is \\\\( d \\\\), the length of the segment from the center to the chord is \\\\( k \\\\), and the length of the segment from \\\\( P \\\\) to the point where the perpendicular from the center meets the chord (which is the same as the distance from \\\\( P \\\\) to \\\\( M \\\\)) is \\\\( \\\\sqrt{d^2 - k^2} \\\\).\\n\\nThe length of the chord \\\\( AB \\\\) can also be expressed in terms of the distance from \\\\( P \\\\) to the chord and the distance from \\\\( P \\\\) to the center of the circle. Specifically, we have:\\n\\\\[\\nPA \\\\cdot PB = (PM - AM)(PM + AM) = PM^2 - AM^2 = d^2 - k^2 - (r^2 - k^2) = d^2 - r^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSince we already know that \\\\( PA \\\\cdot PB = d^2 - r^2 \\\\), we can equate the two expressions for the power of point \\\\( P \\\\):\\n\\\\[\\nd^2 - r^2 = d^2 - r^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis confirms our setup. Now, we need to find \\\\( k \\\\) in terms of \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\). From the right triangle formed by the radius, the distance from the center to the chord, and the segment from the center to \\\\( P \\\\), we have:\\n\\\\[\\nd^2 = r^2 + k^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSolving for \\\\( k^2 \\\\), we get:\\n\\\\[\\nk^2 = d^2 - r^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\\n\\\\[\\nk = \\\\sqrt{d^2 - r^2}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThus, the value of \\\\( k \\\\) in terms of \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{\\\\sqrt{d^2 - r^2}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nA sequence of numbers starts with 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the squares of the digits of the previous number.

This pattern continues until the sequence reaches a number that is not a single-digit number. The sequence then continues with the sum of the squares of the digits of this new number. If the sequence starts with 1 and continues as described, what is the 10th number in the sequence?\\nTo determine the 10th number in the sequence, we start by noting the rule: each number in the sequence is the sum of the squares of the digits of the previous number.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:\\n\\n1. **Express the terms of the sequence:** We know that $a_{n+1} + a_n = 2^n$. We can express the terms of the sequence in terms of the previous terms and the given relation. 2. **Find the initial terms:** We need to find the first few terms of the sequence to identify a pattern or to use them to find the sum of the first 10 terms. 3. **Sum the first 10 terms:** Once we have the terms, we can sum them to find $S_{10}$. Let's start by expressing the first few terms of the sequence:\\n\\n- For $n=1$: $a_2 + a_1 = 2^1 = 2$\\n- For $n=2$: $a_3 + a_2 = 2^2 = 4$\\n- For $n=3$: $a_4 + a_3 = 2^3 = 8$\\n- For $n=4$: $a_5 + a_4 = 2^4 = 16$\\n- And so on...\\n\\nTo find the sum of the first 10 terms, we can use the given relation to express each term in terms of the previous terms. However, we need to find a pattern or a way to sum the terms directly. Let's use Python and sympy to help us find the sum of the first 10 terms. ```python\\nimport sympy as sp\\n\\n# Define the sequence terms\\na = sp.symbols('a1:11')  # This creates symbols a1, a2, ..., a10\\n\\n# Define the equations based on the given relation a_{n+1} + a_n = 2^n\\nequations = [a[i] + a[i+1] - 2**i for i in range(9)]\\n\\n# Solve the equations to find the terms\\nsolutions = sp.solve(equations, a[1:])\\n\\n# Substitute the solutions into the sequence terms\\na_values = [a[0]] + [solutions[a[i]] for i in range(9)]\\n\\n# Calculate the sum of the first 10 terms\\nS_10 = sum(a_values)\\n\\n# Simplify the sum\\nS_10_simplified = sp.simplify(S_10)\\nprint(S_10_simplified)\\n```\\n```output\\n682\\n```\\nThe sum of the first 10 terms of the sequence $\\\\{a_n\\\\}$, given that $a_{n+1} + a_n = 2^n$, is $\\\\boxed{682}$.

A: $1$\\nB: $2$\\nC: $3$\\nD: $4$\\n\\nAssistant: To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of an arithmetic sequence. Let's denote the first term of the sequence by \\\\(a_1\\\\) and the common difference by \\\\(d\\\\). The general formula for the \\\\(n\\\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\\n\\\\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\\\]\\n\\nGiven:\\n1. \\\\(a_1 + a_5 = 10\\\\)\\n2. \\\\(a_4 = 7\\\\)\\n\\nUsing the general formula, we can express \\\\(a_5\\\\) and \\\\(a_4\\\\) in terms of \\\\(a_1\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\):\\n\\\\[a_5 = a_1 + 4d\\\\]\\n\\\\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 7\\\\]\\n\\nNow we can substitute \\\\(a_5\\\\) into the first equation:\\n\\\\[a_1 + (a_1 + 4d) = 10\\\\]\\n\\\\[2a_1 + 4d = 10\\\\]\\n\\\\[a_1 + 2d = 5\\\\]\\n\\nWe now have two equations:\\n1. \\\\(a_1 + 3d = 7\\\\)\\n2. \\\\(a_1 + 2d = 5\\\\)\\n\\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to find \\\\(a_1\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\). Subtract the second equation from the first:\\n\\\\[(a_1 + 3d) - (a_1 + 2d) = 7 - 5\\\\]\\n\\\\[d = 2\\\\]\\n\\nSo, the common difference \\\\(d\\\\) is 2. Let's verify this by substituting \\\\(d = 2\\\\) back into the equations. We can use the second equation:\\n\\\\[a_1 + 2(2) = 5\\\\]\\n\\\\[a_1 + 4 = 5\\\\]\\n\\\\[a_1 = 1\\\\]\\n\\nNow let's check if this value of \\\\(a_1\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\) satisfies the first equation:\\n\\\\[a_1 + a_5 = a_1 + (a_1 + 4d) = 1 + (1 + 4 \\\\cdot 2) = 1 + 9 = 10\\\\]\\n\\nEverything checks out, so the common difference \\\\(d\\\\) is indeed 2.
